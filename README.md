## Week 2 Assessment

### Part 1: Big O Notation
[Follow this link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1JdePnLtVfAaauY9nZZ0Smve70RWrncQPFRyBtj1TuEQ/viewform?usp=send_form) to complete a brief quiz about searching and sorting algorithms.

### Part 2: Binary Search Tree
Fork and clone this repo and get some tests passing!

**DO NOT:** All of your methods should dynamically generate the requested output. In other words, it's cheating to store the input array as an instance variable for later reference, or have a "count" instance variable that you increment up during the initialization process.

**DO!**

* Check out the [Intro to Trees lesson](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/unit-5-files-data-structures-and-algorithms/intro-to-trees) from the reading if you need a refresher on how binary search works.

* Red! Green! **Refactor!**

* Complete the tests for the Node object first, which should be very fast.

* Complete the tests for BinarySearchTree's `new` and `find_node_with_value` methods after that.

**GOOD LUCK!**
